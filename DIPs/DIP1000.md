## Abstract

A garbage collected language is inherently memory safe. References to data can
be passed around without concern for ownership, lifetimes, etc. But this runs
into difficulty when combined with other sorts of memory management, like stack
allocation, malloc/free allocation, reference counting, etc.

Knowing when the lifetime of a reference is over is critical for safely
implementing memory management schemes other than tracing garbage collection.
It is also critical for the performance of reference counting systems, as it
will expose opportunities for elision of the inc/dec operations.

`scope` provides a mechanism to guarantee that a reference cannot escape lexical scope.

This is a reboot of DIP69. It differs in that it builds on the success of DIP25
by using `return` `scope` to indicate scope parameters that can be returned by
the function.

## Description

### Benefits

- References to stack variables can no longer escape.
- Delegates currently defensively allocate closures with the GC. Few actually escape, and with `scope` only those that actually escape need to have the closures allocated.
- `@system` code like `std.internal.scopebuffer` can be made `@safe`.
- Reference counting systems need not adjust the count when passing references that do not escape.
- Better self-documentation of encapsulation.

### Definitions

#### Visibility vs. lifetime

For each value `v` within a program we define the notion of <i>lexical
visibility</i> denoted as `visibility(v)`, akin to the lexical extent through
which the value can be accessed.

- For an rvalue, the visibility is the expression within which it is used.
- For a named variable in a scope, the visibility is the lexical scope of the variable per the language rules.
- For a module-level variable, visibility is considered infinite. Notation: `visibility(v)` `=` `∞`.

Due to language scoping rules, visibilities cannot partially intersect or
"cross": for any two values, either they are not simultaneously visible at all,
or one's visibility is included within the other's. We define a partial order
among visibilities: `visibility(v1)` `<=` `visibility(v2)` if `v2` is visible
through all portions of program when `v1` is visible (including the case where
both values have infinite visibilities). If two variables have disjoint
visibilities, they are unordered.

We also define <i>lifetime</i> for each value, which is the extent during which
a value can be safely used.

- For types without indirections such as `int`, visibility and lifetime are equal for rvalues and lvalues.
- For all global and `static` variables, lifetime is infinite.
- For values allocated on the garbage collected heap, lifetime is infinite whilst visibility is dependent on the references in the program bound to those values.
- For an unrestricted pointer, visibility is dictated by the usual lexical scope rules. Lifetime, however is dictated by the lifetime of the data to which the pointer points to.

Examples:

``` D
void fun1() {
    int x; // starting here, x becomes visible and also starts "living"
    int y = x + 42; // lifetime(42) and visibility(42) last through the initialization expression
    ...
   // lifetime(y) and visibility(y) end here, just before those of x
   // lifetime(x) and visibility(x) end here
}

void fun2() {
    int * p; // visibility(p) occurs from here through the end of the function
    // at this point lifetime(p) is infinite because it is null and lifetime(null) is infinite
    if (...) {
        int x;
        p = &x; // lifetime(p) is now equal to lifetime(x)
    }
    // here lifetime(p) may have ended but p is still visible
}
```

If a value is visible but its lifetime has ended, the program is in a
dangerous, albeit not necessarily incorrect state. The program becomes
undefined if the value of which lifetime has ended is actually used.

This proposal ensures statically that variables in `@safe` code with the
`scope` storage class have a lifetime that includes their visibility, so they
are safe to use at all times.

By consequence of the above, inside a function:

- Parameters passed by `scope` are conservatively assumed to have lifetime somewhere in the caller's scope;
- Parameters passed by value have shorter lifetime than those passed by passed by `ref`/`out`/`scope`, but longer than any locals defined by the function. The lifetimes of by-value parameters are ordered lexically.

#### Algebra of Lifetimes

Certain expressions create values of which lifetime is in relationship with the
participating value lifetimes, as follows:

| expression               |  lifetime    |  notes                                 |
|--------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| `&e`                     | lifetime(e)  |                                        |
| `&*e`                    | lifetime(e)  |                                        |
| `e + integer`            | lifetime(e)  | Applies only when e is a pointer type  |
| `e - integer`            | lifetime(e)  | Applies only when e is a pointer type  |
| `*e`                     | ∞            | Lifetime is not transitive             |
| `e1, e2`                 | lifetime(e2) |                                        |
| `e1 op= e2`              | lifetime(e1) |                                        |
| `e1 ? e2 : e3`           | min(lifetime(e2), lifetime(e3)) |                     |
| `e++`                    | lifetime(e)  | Applies only when e is a pointer type. This has academic value only because pointer increment is disallowed in @safe code. |
| `e--`                    | lifetime(e)  | Applies only when e is a pointer type. This has academic value only because pointer decrement is disallowed in @safe code. |
| `cast(T) e`              | lifetime(e)  | Applies only when both T and e have pointer type. |
| `new`                    | ∞            | Allocates on the GC heap.              |
| `e.field`                | lifetime(e)  |                                        |
| `e.func(args)`           |              | See section dedicated to discussing methods. |
| `func(args)`             |              | See section dedicated to discussing functions. |
| `e[]`                    | lifetime(e)  |                                        |
| `e[i..j]`                | lifetime(e)  |                                        |
| `&e[i]`                  | lifetime(e)  |                                        |
| `e[i]`                   | ∞            |                                        |
| _ArrayLiteral_           | ∞            | Array literals are allocated on the GC heap |
| _ArrayLiteral[constant]_ | ∞            | Array literals are allocated on the GC heap |

### Aggregates

The following sections define `scope` working on primitive types (such as
`int`) and pointers thereof (such as `int*`). This is without loss of
generality because aggregates can be handled by decomposition as follows:

-   From a lifetime analysis viewpoint, a `struct` is considered a
    juxtaposition of its direct members. Passing a `struct` by value into a
    function is equivalent to passing each of its members by value. Passing a
    `struct` by `ref` is equivalent to passing each of its members by `ref`.
    Finally, passing a pointer to a `struct` is analyzed as passing a pointer
    to each of its members. Example:

    ``` D
    struct A { int x; float y; }
    void fun(A a); // analyzed similarly to fun(int x, float y);
    void gun(ref A a); // analyzed similarly to gun(ref int x, ref float y);
    void hun(A* a); // analyzed similarly to hun(int* x, float* y);
    ```

-   Lifetimes of statically-sized arrays `T[n]` is analyzed as if the array
    were a `struct` with `n` fields, each of type `T`.

-   Lifetimes of built-in dynamically-sized slices `T[]` are analyzed as
    `struct`s with two fields, one of type `T*` and the other of type `size_t`.

-   Analysis of lifetimes of `class` types is similar to analysis of pointers
    to `struct` types.

-   For `struct` members of aggregate type, decomposition may continue
    transitively.

### Fundamentals of `scope`

The `scope` storage class ensures that the lifetime of a pointer/reference is a
shorter of the lifetime of the referred object. Dereferencing through a `scope`
variable is guaranteed to be safe.

`scope` is a storage class, and affects declarations. It is not a type
qualifier. There is no change to existing [`scope`
grammar](http://dlang.org/attribute#scope). It fits in the grammar as a storage
class.

`scope` affects:

-   local variables allocated on the stack
-   function parameters
-   non-static member functions (applying to the `this` implicit parameter)
-   delegates (applying to their implicit environment)
-   return value of functions

It is ignored for other declarations. It is ignored for declarations that have
no indirections.

``` D
scope enum e = 3;  // ignored, no indirections
scope int i;       // ignored, no indirections
```

The `scope` storage class affects variables according to these rules:

1. A `scope` variable can only be initialized and assigned from values that
   have lifetimes longer than the variable's lifetime. (As a consequence a `scope`
   variable can only be assigned to `scope` variables that have shorter lifetime.)
2. A variable is inferred to be `scope` if it is initialized with a value that
   has a non-∞ lifetime.
3. A `scope` variable cannot be initialized with the address of a `scope`
   variable. (If it did it would lose the `scope` attribute of the latter's
   contents.)
4. A `return` `scope` parameter can be initialized with another `return`
   `scope` parameter—`return` `scope` is idempotent.

Examples for each rule:

``` D
int global_var;
int* global_ptr;

void bar(scope int* input);

void fun1() {
    scope int* a = &global_var; // OK per rule 1, lifetime(&global_var) > lifetime(a)
    a = &global_var;       // OK per rule 1, lifetime(&global_var) > lifetime(a)
    int b;
    a = &b; // Disallowed per rule 1, lifetime(&b) < lifetime(a)
    scope c = &b; // OK per rule 1, lifetime(&b) > lifetime(c)
    int* b;
    a = b; // Disallowed per rule 1, lifetime(b) < lifetime(a)
}

void fun2() {
    auto a = &global_var; // OK, b is a regular int*
    int b;
    auto c = &b; // Per rule 2, c has scope storage class
}

void fun3(scope int * p1) {
    scope int** p2 = &p1; // Disallowed per rule 3
    scope int* p3;
    scope int** p4 = &p3; // Disallowed per rule 3
}

void fun4(scope int * p1) {
    bar(p1); // OK per rule 4
}
```

A few more examples combining the rules:

``` D
int global_var;
int* global_ptr;

void bar(scope int* input);

void foo() {
    scope int* a;
    a = &global_var;       // Ok, `global_var` has a greater lifetime than `a`
    scope b = &global_var; // Ok, type deduction
    int c;

    if(...) {
        scope x = a;       // Ok, copy of reference,`x` has shorter lifetime than `a`
        scope y = &c;      // Ok, lifetime(y) < lifetime(& c)
        int z;
        b = &z;            // Error, `b` will outlive `z`
        int* d = a;        // Ok: d is inferred to be `scope`
    }

    bar(a);                // Ok, scoped pointer is passed to scoped parameter
    bar(&c);               // Ok, lifetime(parameter input) < lifetime(c)
    int* e;
    e = &c;                // Error, lifetime(e's view) is &infin; and is greater than lifetime(c)
    a = e;                 // Ok, lifetime(a) < lifetime(e)
    scope int** f = &a;    // Error, rule 4
    scope int** h = &e;    // Ok
    int* j = *h;           // Ok, scope is not transitive
}

void abc() {
    scope int* a;
    int* b;
    scope int* c = a;      // Error, rule 5
    scope int* d = b;      // Ok
    int* i = a;            // Ok, scope is inferred for i
    global_ptr = d;        // Error, lifetime(d) < lifetime(global_ptr)
    global_ptr = i;        // Error, lifetime(i) < lifetime(global_ptr)
    int* j;
    global_ptr = j;        // Ok, j is not scope
}
```

### Interaction of `scope` with the `return` Statement

A value containing indirections and annotated with `scope` cannot be returned
from a function.

``` D
class C { ... }

C fun1() {
    scope C c;
    ...
    return c;   // Error
}

int fun2() {
    scope int i;
    ...
    return i;   // Ok, i has no indirections
}

scope int* fun3() {
    scope int* p;
    return p;   // Error
    return p+1; // Error, nice try!
    return &*p; // Error, won't work either
}

int* func(return scope int* r, scope int* s, int* t)
{
    return r; // Ok
    return s; // Error
    return t; // Ok
}
```

### Functions

#### Inference

`scope` is inferred for function parameters if not specified, under the same
circumstances as `pure`, `nothrow`, `@nogc`, and `@safe` are inferred. Scope is
not inferred for virtual functions.

#### Overloading

`scope` does not affect overloading. If it did, then whether a variable was
scope or not would affect the code path, making scope inference impractical. It
also makes turning scope checking on/off impractical.

``` D
T func(scope T);
T func(T);

T t; func(t); // Error, ambiguous
scope T u; func(u); // Error, ambiguous
```

#### Implicit Conversion of Function Pointers and Delegates

`scope` can be added to parameters, but not removed.

``` D
alias T function(T) fp_t;
alias T function(scope T) fps_t;
alias T function(return scope T) fprs_t;

T foo(T);
T bar(scope T);
T abc(return scope T);

fp_t   fp = &foo;   // Ok
fp_t   fp = &bar;   // Ok
fp_t   fp = &abc;   // Error

fps_t  fp = &foo;   // Error
fps_t  fp = &bar;   // Ok
fps_t  fp = &abc;   // Error

fprs_t fp = &foo;   // Ok
fprs_t fp = &bar;   // Ok
fprs_t fp = &abc;   // Ok
```

#### Inheritance

Overriding functions inherit any `scope` annotations from their antecedents.
Scope is covariant, meaning it can be added to overriding functions. In other
words, overriding functions must be implicitly convertible to its antecedent.

``` D
class C
{
    T foo(T);
    T bar(scope T);
    T abc(return scope T);
}

class D : C
{
    override T foo(scope T);        // Ok, can add scope
    override T foo(return scope T); // Error

    override T bar(T);              // Error, cannot remove scope
    override T bar(return scope T); // Error

    override T abc(T);              // Ok
    override T abc(scope T);        // Ok
}
```

#### Mangling

In cases where scope is ignored, it does not contribute to the mangling. Scope
parameters will be mangled with 'M'. `return` `scope` with 'MNk'.

#### Nested Functions

Nested functions have more objects available than just their arguments:

``` D
ref T foo() {
  T t;
  ref T func() { return t; }
  return func();  // disallowed
}
```

Nested functions are analyzed as if each variable accessed outside of its scope
was passed as a ref parameter. All parameters have scope inferred from how they
are used in the function body.

### Pointers

#### Escaping via Return

The simple cases of this are already disallowed prior to this DIP:

``` D
T* func(T t) {
  T u;
  return &t; // Error: escaping reference to local t
  return &u; // Error: escaping reference to local u
}
```

But are easily circumvented:

``` D
T* func(T t) {
  T* p = &t;
  return p;  // no error detected
}
```

@safe currently deals with this by preventing taking the address of a local:

``` D
T* func(T t) @safe {
  T* p = &t; // Error: cannot take address of parameter t in @safe function func
  return p;
}
```

This is restrictive. The `scope` storage class was introduced which annotates
the pointer. `scope` can only appear in certain contexts, in particular
function parameters and local variables.

Scope can be passed down to functions:

``` D
void func(scope T* t) @safe;
void bar(scope T* t) @safe {
   func(t); // ok
}
```

But the following idiom is far too useful to be disallowed:

``` D
T* func(T* t) {
  return t; // ok
}
```

And if it is misused it can result in stack corruption:

``` D
T* foo() {
  T* t;
  return func(&t); // currently, no error detected, despite returning pointer to t
}
```

The:

``` D
return func(t);
```

case is detected by all of the following conditions being true:

-   foo() returns a pointer
-   func() returns a pointer
-   func() has one or more parameters that are pointers
-   1 or more of the arguments to those parameters are scope objects local to foo()
-   Those arguments can be @safe-ly converted from the parameter to the return type.

For example, if the return type is larger than the parameter type, the return
type cannot be a reference to the argument. If the return type is a pointer,
and the parameter type is a size\_t, it cannot be a reference to the argument.
The larger a list of these cases can be made, the more code will pass @safe
checks without requiring further annotation.

#### returning `scope`

The above solution is correct, but a bit restrictive. After all, `func(t,` `u)`
could be returning a pointer to non-local `u`, not local `t`, and so should
work. To fix this, introduce the concept of `return` `scope`:

``` D
T* func(scope T* t, T* u) {
  return t; // Error: escaping scope t
  return u; // ok
}
```

Scope means that the pointer is guaranteed not to escape.

``` D
T* u;
T* foo() @safe {
  T t;
  return func(&t, u); // Ok, u is not local
  return func(u, &t); // Error: escaping scope t
}
```

This minimizes the number of `scope` annotations required.

#### Scope Function Returns

`scope` can be applied to function return values (even though it is not a type
qualifier). It must be applied to the left of the declaration, in the same way
`ref` is:

``` D
int* foo() scope;     // applies to 'this' reference
scope: int* foo();    // applies to 'this' reference
scope { int* foo(); } // applies to 'this' reference
scope int* foo();     // applies to return value
```

The lifetime of a scope return value is the lifetime of an rvalue. It may not
be copied in a way that extends its life.

``` D
int* bar(scope int*);
scope int* foo();
...
return foo();         // Error, lifetime(return) > lifetime(foo())
int* p = foo();       // Error, lifetime(p) is &infin;
bar(foo());           // Ok, lifetime(foo()) > lifetime(bar())
scope int* q = foo(); // error, lifetime(q) > lifetime(rvalue)
```

This enables scope return values to be safely chained from function to
function; in particular it also allows a ref counted struct to safely expose a
reference to its wrapped type.

A parameter can be marked as `return` `scope` meaning that parameter may be
returned by the function. The return value is treated as if the function were
annotated with `scope`.

### Classes

Scope class semantics are equivalent to a pointer to a struct.

### Static Arrays

Scope static array semantics are equivalent to a scope struct:

``` D
T[3] a;
struct A { T t0, t1, t2; } A a;
```

### @safe

Errors for scope violations are only reported in @safe code.

### Major Idioms Enabled

#### Identity function

``` D
T identity(T)(T x) { return x; } // overload 1
ref T identity(T)(ref T x) { return x; } // overload 2
```

Even if the body of `identity` weren't available, the compiler can infer it is
escaping its parameter.

If `identity` is applied to a `scope` variable (including `scope` `ref`
parameters), then overload 2 is not a match because per the rules `scope` `ref`
cannot bind to `ref`. Therefore, overload 1 will match. Example:

``` D
void fun(int a, ref int b, scope ref int c) {
    auto x = identity(42); // rvalue, overload 1 matches
    auto y = identity(a); // lvalue, overload 2 matches
    auto z = identity(c); // scope ref value, overload 1 matches
}
```

In fact both overloads can be integrated in a single signature:

``` D
auto ref T identity(T)(auto ref T x) { return x; }
```

#### Owning Containers

Containers that own their data will be able to give access to elements by
`scope` `ref`. The compiler ensures that the references returned never outlive
the container. Therefore, the container can deallocate its payload (subject to
control of multiple container copies, e.g. by means of reference counting). A
basic outline of a reference counted slice is shown below:

``` D
@safe struct RefCountedSlice(T) {
    private T[] payload;
    private uint* count;
    this(size_t initialSize) {
        payload = new T[initialSize];
        count = new size_t;
        *count = 1;
    }
    this(this) {
        if (count) ++*count;
    }
    void opAssign(Container rhs) {
        this.__dtor();
        payload = rhs.payload;
        count = rhs.count;
        ++*count;
    }
    // Interesting fact #1: destructor can be @trusted
    @trusted ~this()  {
        if (count && !--*count) {
            delete payload;
            delete refs;
        }
    }
    // Interesting fact #2: references to internals can be given away
    scope ref T opIndex(size_t i) {
        return payload[i];
    }
    ...
}
```

`RefCountedSlice` mimics the semantics of `T[]` with the notable difference
that the payload is deallocated automatically when it is no longer used. It is
usable in `@safe` code because the compiler ensures statically a `ref` to an
element may never outlive the slice.

### Breaking changes / deprecation process

Some code will no longer work. Although inference will take care of a lot of
cases, there are still some that will fail.

``` D
int i,j;
int* p = &i;  // Ok, scope is inferred for p
int* q;
q = &i;   // Error: too late to infer scope for q
```

Currently, `scope` is ignored except that a new class use to initialize a scope
variable allocates the class instance on the stack. Fortunately, this can work
with this new proposal, with an optimization that recognizes that if a new
class is unique, and assigned to a scope variable, then that instance can be
placed on the stack.

#### Implementation Plan

Turning this on may cause significant breakage, and may also be found to be an
unworkable design. Therefore, implementation stages will be:

-   enable new behavior with a compiler switch `-scope`
-   remove `-scope`, issue warning when errors are detected
-   replace warnings with deprecation messages
-   replace deprecations with errors
